        FAQ(question: "Why Detroit 909?" , answer: "I created Detroit 909 to pay homage to the classic 80's drum machine from Roland the TR909 and Detroit, the birthplace of Techno music. As a child, I grew up in Windsor, Canada, a neighbouring city of Detroit, and was where I would get most of my music I would hear from the radio stations. Here is where I would first hear the Detroit sounds."),

        FAQ(question: "Who is the team behind Detroit 909?", answer: "Hi there! That would be me! My name is Matt, and I am an iOS Engineer from Canada, now living and working on the west coast in Vancouver. I am passionate about app development and making techno music, which led me to build this app. Other than coding and techno music, I love travelling to Japan and studying the language and culture. Plus, playing the bagpipe.")
